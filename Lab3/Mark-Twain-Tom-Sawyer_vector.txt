MOST
of
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
book
really
occurred
one
or
two
were
experiences
of
my
own
the
rest
those
of
boys
who
were
schoolmates
of
mine
Huck
Finn
is
drawn
from
life
Tom
Sawyer
also
but
not
from
an
individualhe
is
a
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
three
boys
whom
I
knew
and
therefore
belongs
to
the
composite
order
of
architecture
The
odd
superstitions
touched
upon
were
all
prevalent
among
children
and
slaves
in
the
West
at
the
period
of
this
storythat
is
to
say
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
Although
my
book
is
intended
mainly
for
the
entertainment
of
boys
and
girls
I
hope
it
will
not
be
shunned
by
men
and
women
on
that
account
for
part
of
my
plan
has
been
to
try
to
pleasantly
remind
adults
of
what
they
once
were
themselves
and
of
how
they
felt
and
thought
and
talked
and
what
queer
enterprises
they
sometimes
engaged
in
No
answer
No
answer
gone
with
that
boy
I
wonder
You
TOM
No
answer
The
old
lady
pulled
her
spectacles
down
and
looked
over
them
about
the
room
then
she
put
them
up
and
looked
out
under
them
She
seldom
or
never
looked
THROUGH
them
for
so
small
a
thing
as
a
boy
they
were
her
state
pair
the
pride
of
her
heart
and
were
built
for
not
serviceshe
could
have
seen
through
a
pair
of
stovelids
just
as
well
She
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
not
fiercely
but
still
loud
enough
for
the
furniture
to
hear
I
lay
if
I
get
hold
of
you
Ill
She
did
not
finish
for
by
this
time
she
was
bending
down
and
punching
under
the
bed
with
the
broom
and
so
she
needed
breath
to
punctuate
the
punches
with
She
resurrected
nothing
but
the
cat
never
did
see
the
beat
of
that
boy
She
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
in
it
and
looked
out
among
the
tomato
vines
and
weeds
that
constituted
the
garden
No
Tom
So
she
lifted
up
her
voice
at
an
angle
calculated
for
distance
and
shouted
TOM
There
was
a
slight
noise
behind
her
and
she
turned
just
in
time
to
seize
a
small
boy
by
the
slack
of
his
roundabout
and
arrest
his
flight
I
might
thought
of
that
closet
What
you
been
doing
in
there
Look
at
your
hands
And
look
at
your
mouth
What
IS
that
truck
dont
know
aunt
I
know
Its
jamthats
what
it
is
Forty
times
Ive
said
if
you
didnt
let
that
jam
alone
Id
skin
you
Hand
me
that
switch
The
switch
hovered
in
the
airthe
peril
was
desperate
Look
behind
you
aunt
The
old
lady
whirled
round
and
snatched
her
skirts
out
of
danger
The
lad
fled
on
the
instant
scrambled
up
the
high
boardfence
and
disappeared
over
it
His
aunt
Polly
stood
surprised
a
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
gentle
laugh
the
boy
cant
I
never
learn
anything
Aint
he
played
me
tricks
enough
like
that
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
by
this
time
But
old
fools
is
the
biggest
fools
there
is
Cant
learn
an
old
dog
new
tricks
as
the
saying
is
But
my
goodness
he
never
plays
them
alike
two
days
and
how
is
a
body
to
know
whats
coming
He
to
know
just
how
long
he
can
torment
me
before
I
get
my
dander
up
and
he
knows
if
he
can
make
out
to
put
me
off
for
a
minute
or
make
me
laugh
its
all
down
again
and
I
cant
hit
him
a
lick
I
aint
doing
my
duty
by
that
boy
and
thats
the
Lords
truth
goodness
knows
Spare
the
rod
and
spile
the
child
as
the
Good
Book
says
Im
a
laying
up
sin
and
suffering
for
us
both
I
know
Hes
full
of
the
Old
Scratch
but
lawsame
hes
my
own
dead
sisters
boy
poor
thing
and
I
aint
got
the
heart
to
lash
him
somehow
Every
time
I
let
him
off
my
conscience
does
hurt
me
so
and
every
time
I
hit
him
my
old
heart
most
breaks
Wellawell
man
that
is
born
of
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
as
the
Scripture
says
and
I
reckon
its
so
Hell
play
hookey
this
evening
and
Southwestern
for
Ill
just
be
obleeged
to
make
him
work
tomorrow
to
punish
him
Its
mighty
hard
to
make
him
work
Saturdays
when
all
the
boys
is
having
holiday
but
he
hates
work
more
than
he
hates
anything
else
and
Ive
GOT
to
do
some
of
my
duty
by
him
or
Ill
be
the
ruination
of
the
child
Tom
did
play
hookey
and
he
had
a
very
good
time
He
got
back
home
barely
in
season
to
help
Jim
the
small
colored
boy
saw
nextdays
wood
and
split
the
kindlings
before
supperat
least
he
was
there
in
time
to
tell
his
adventures
to
Jim
while
Jim
did
threefourths
of
the
work
Toms
younger
brother
rather
halfbrother
Sid
was
already
through
with
his
part
of
the
work
up
chips
for
he
was
a
quiet
boy
and
had
no
adventurous
troublesome
ways
While
Tom
was
eating
his
supper
and
stealing
sugar
as
opportunity
offered
Aunt
Polly
asked
him
questions
that
were
full
of
guile
and
very
deepfor
she
wanted
to
trap
him
into
damaging
revealments
Like
many
other
simplehearted
souls
it
was
her
pet
vanity
to
believe
she
was
endowed
with
a
talent
for
dark
and
mysterious
diplomacy
and
she
loved
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent
devices
as
marvels
of
low
cunning
Said
she
it
was
middling
warm
in
school
warnt
it
warm
warnt
it
you
want
to
go
in
aswimming
Tom
A
bit
of
a
scare
shot
through
Toma
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
He
searched
Aunt
Pollys
face
but
it
told
him
nothing
So
he
said
not
very
much
The
old
lady
reached
out
her
hand
and
felt
Toms
shirt
and
said
you
aint
too
warm
now
though
And
it
flattered
her
to
reflect
that
she
had
discovered
that
the
shirt
was
dry
without
anybody
knowing
that
that
was
what
she
had
in
her
mind
But
in
spite
of
her
Tom
knew
where
the
wind
lay
now
So
he
forestalled
what
might
be
the
next
move
of
us
pumped
on
our
headsmines
damp
yet
See
Aunt
Polly
was
vexed
to
think
she
had
overlooked
that
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
missed
a
trick
Then
she
had
a
new
inspiration
you
didnt
have
to
undo
your
shirt
collar
where
I
sewed
it
to
pump
on
your
head
did
you
Unbutton
your
jacket
The
trouble
vanished
out
of
Toms
face
He
opened
his
jacket
His
shirt
collar
was
securely
sewed
Well
go
with
you
Id
made
sure
youd
played
hookey
and
been
aswimming
But
I
forgive
ye
Tom
I
reckon
youre
a
kind
of
a
singed
cat
as
the
saying
isbettern
you
look
THIS
time
She
was
half
sorry
her
sagacity
had
miscarried
and
half
glad
that
Tom
had
stumbled
into
obedient
conduct
for
once
But
Sidney
said
now
if
I
didnt
think
you
sewed
his
collar
with
white
thread
but
its
black
I
did
sew
it
with
white
Tom
But
Tom
did
not
wait
for
the
rest
As
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
said
Ill
lick
you
for
that
In
a
safe
place
Tom
examined
two
large
needles
which
were
thrust
into
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
and
had
thread
bound
about
themone
needle
carried
white
thread
and
the
other
black
He
said
never
noticed
if
it
hadnt
been
for
Sid
Confound
it
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
white
and
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
black
I
wish
to
geeminy
shed
stick
to
one
or
totherI
cant
keep
the
run
of
But
I
bet
you
Ill
lam
Sid
for
that
Ill
learn
him
He
was
not
the
Model
Boy
of
the
village
He
knew
the
model
boy
very
well
thoughand
loathed
him
Within
two
minutes
or
even
less
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles
Not
because
his
troubles
were
one
whit
less
heavy
and
bitter
to
him
than
a
mans
are
to
a
man
but
because
a
new
and
powerful
interest
bore
them
down
and
drove
them
out
of
his
mind
for
the
timejust
as
mens
misfortunes
are
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
new
enterprises
This
new
interest
was
a
valued
novelty
in
whistling
which
he
had
just
acquired
from
a
negro
and
he
was
suffering
to
practise
it
undisturbed
It
consisted
in
a
peculiar
birdlike
turn
a
sort
of
liquid
warble
produced
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
at
short
intervals
in
the
midst
of
the
musicthe
reader
probably
remembers
how
to
do
it
if
he
has
ever
been
a
boy
Diligence
and
attention
soon
gave
him
the
knack
of
it
and
he
strode
down
the
street
with
his
mouth
full
of
harmony
and
his
soul
full
of
gratitude
He
felt
much
as
an
astronomer
feels
who
has
discovered
a
new
planetno
doubt
as
far
as
strong
deep
unalloyed
pleasure
is
concerned
the
advantage
was
with
the
boy
not
the
astronomer
The
summer
evenings
were
long
It
was
not
dark
yet
Presently
Tom
checked
his
whistle
A
stranger
was
before
hima
boy
a
shade
larger
than
himself
A
newcomer
of
any
age
or
either
sex
was
an
impressive
curiosity
in
the
poor
little
shabby
village
of
St
Petersburg
This
boy
was
well
dressed
toowell
dressed
on
a
weekday
This
was
simply
astounding
His
cap
was
a
dainty
thing
his
closebuttoned
blue
cloth
roundabout
was
new
and
natty
and
so
were
his
pantaloons
He
had
shoes
onand
it
was
only
Friday
He
even
wore
a
necktie
a
bright
bit
of
ribbon
He
had
a
citified
air
about
him
that
ate
into
Toms
vitals
The
more
Tom
stared
at
the
splendid
marvel
the
higher
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
his
finery
and
the
shabbier
and
shabbier
his
own
outfit
seemed
to
him
to
grow
Neither
boy
spoke
If
one
moved
the
other
movedbut
only
sidewise
in
a
circle
they
kept
face
to
face
and
eye
to
eye
all
the
time
Finally
Tom
said
can
lick
you
like
to
see
you
try
it
I
can
do
it
you
cant
either
I
can
you
cant
can
cant
An
uncomfortable
pause
Then
Tom
said
your
name
any
of
your
business
maybe
I
Ill
MAKE
it
my
business
why
dont
you
you
say
much
I
will
There
now
you
think
youre
mighty
smart
DONT
you
I
could
lick
you
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
if
I
wanted
to
why
dont
you
DO
it
You
SAY
you
can
do
it
I
WILL
if
you
fool
with
me
yesIve
seen
whole
families
in
the
same
fix
You
think
youre
SOME
now
DONT
you
Oh
what
a
hat
can
lump
that
hat
if
you
dont
like
it
I
dare
you
to
knock
it
offand
anybody
thatll
take
a
dare
will
suck
eggs
a
liar
another
a
fighting
liar
and
dasnt
take
it
up
a
walk
you
give
me
much
more
of
your
sass
Ill
take
and
bounce
a
rock
offn
your
head
of
COURSE

will
I
WILL
why
dont
you
DO
it
then
What
do
you
keep
SAYING
you
will
for
Why
dont
you
DO
it
Its
because
youre
afraid
AINT
afraid
are
aint
are
Another
pause
and
more
eying
and
sidling
around
each
other
Presently
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
Tom
said
away
from
here
away
yourself
wont
wont
either
So
they
stood
each
with
a
foot
placed
at
an
angle
as
a
brace
and
both
shoving
with
might
and
main
and
glowering
at
each
other
with
hate
But
neither
could
get
an
advantage
After
struggling
till
both
were
hot
and
flushed
each
relaxed
his
strain
with
watchful
caution
and
Tom
said
a
coward
and
a
pup
Ill
tell
my
big
brother
on
you
and
he
can
thrash
you
with
his
little
finger
and
Ill
make
him
do
it
too
do
I
care
for
your
big
brother
Ive
got
a
brother
thats
bigger
than
he
isand
whats
more
he
can
throw
him
over
that
fence
too
brothers
were
imaginary
a
lie
saying
so
dont
make
it
so
Tom
drew
a
line
in
the
dust
with
his
big
toe
and
said
dare
you
to
step
over
that
and
Ill
lick
you
till
you
cant
stand
up
Anybody
thatll
take
a
dare
will
steal
sheep
The
new
boy
stepped
over
promptly
and
said
you
said
youd
do
it
now
lets
see
you
do
it
you
crowd
me
now
you
better
look
out
you
SAID
youd
do
itwhy
dont
you
do
it
jingo
for
two
cents
I
WILL
do
it
The
new
boy
took
two
broad
coppers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
them
out
with
derision
Tom
struck
them
to
the
ground
In
an
instant
both
boys
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
dirt
gripped
together
like
cats
and
for
the
space
of
a
minute
they
tugged
and
tore
at
each
others
hair
and
clothes
punched
and
scratched
each
others
nose
and
covered
themselves
with
dust
and
glory
Presently
the
confusion
took
form
and
through
the
fog
of
battle
Tom
appeared
seated
astride
the
new
boy
and
pounding
him
with
his
fists
said
he
The
boy
only
struggled
to
free
himself
He
was
cryingmainly
from
rage
the
pounding
went
on
At
last
the
stranger
got
out
a
smothered
and
Tom
let
him
up
and
said
thatll
learn
you
Better
look
out
who
youre
fooling
with
next
time
The
new
boy
went
off
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
sobbing
snuffling
and
occasionally
looking
back
and
shaking
his
head
and
threatening
what
he
would
do
to
Tom
the
time
he
caught
him
out
To
which
Tom
responded
with
jeers
and
started
off
in
high
feather
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
the
new
boy
snatched
up
a
stone
threw
it
and
hit
him
between
the
shoulders
and
then
turned
tail
and
ran
like
an
antelope
Tom
chased
the
traitor
home
and
thus
found
out
where
he
lived
He
then
held
a
position
at
the
gate
for
some
time
daring
the
enemy
to
come
outside
but
the
enemy
only
made
faces
at
him
through
the
window
and
declined
At
last
the
enemys
mother
appeared
and
called
Tom
a
bad
vicious
vulgar
child
and
ordered
him
away
So
he
went
away
but
he
said
he
to
for
that
boy
He
got
home
pretty
late
that
night
and
when
he
climbed
cautiously
in
at
the
window
he
uncovered
an
ambuscade
in
the
person
of
his
aunt
and
when
she
saw
the
state
his
clothes
were
in
her
resolution
to
turn
his
Saturday
holiday
into
captivity
at
hard
labor
became
adamantine
in
its
firmness
